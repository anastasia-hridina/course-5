            <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                instructions, they've
                moved to their own section. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation, Native

            <h3>CORE COMPONENTS<span>Chapter 2</span></h3>
            <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the
                app platform‚Äôs
                native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to
                describe the
                appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can
                learn more about
                React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="react">
            <h3>REACT FUNDAMENTALS<span>Chapter 3</span>
            </h3>
            <p>React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript.
                To make the most
                of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a
                refresher
                course.
            </p>
            <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React.</p>
            <p><b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples:
                friendly, approachable
                creatures that
                need names and a cafe to work in.
            </p>
            <p><b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript
                like so: <br>
                <span><Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text></span>.
            </p>
            <p>The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is
                JavaScript, you can
                use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly
                braces inside
                <Text>
            </p>
            <p><b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
            </p>
            <p><b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,
                state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over
                time or
                that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text__input">
            <h3>HANDLING TEXT INPUT<span>Chapter 4</span></h3>
            <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that takes
                a function to
                be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called
                when the text is
                submitted.</p>
            <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language.
                In this new
                language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
                translated as "üçï
                üçï".</p>
