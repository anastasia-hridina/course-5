                    <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using
                        React
                        and
                        the
                        app platform‚Äôs
                        native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as
                        well
                        as to
                        describe the
                        appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:<i>bundles of reusable, nestable
                            code.</i>
                        You
                        can
                        learn more about
                        React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

                    <h3>REACT FUNDAMENTALS<sup>Chapter 3</sup>
                    </h3>
                    <p>React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces
                        with
                        JavaScript.
                        To make the most
                        of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or
                        can
                        serve
                        as a
                        refresher
                        course.
                    </p>
                    <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React.</p>
                    <p><b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples:
                        friendly, approachable
                        creatures that
                        need names and a cafe to work in.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
                        JavaScript
                        like so: <br>
                        <mark>
                            < Text>Hello, I am your cat!.
                                < />
                        </mark>
                    </p>
                    <p>The React docs have<u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more.
                        Because
                        JSX is
                        JavaScript, you can
                        use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <mark>name</mark> for the cat, name, and
                        embedding it
                        with
                        curly
                        braces inside <br><mark>
                            < Text>
                        </mark>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
                        render,
                        state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
                        changes
                        over
                        time or
                        that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

                    <h3>HANDLING TEXT INPUT<sup>Chapter 4</sup></h3>
                    <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                        <i>onChangeText</i>
                        prop
                        that
                        takes
                        a function to
                        be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function
                        to
                        be
                        called
                        when the text is
                        submitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
                        different
                        language.
                        In this new
                        language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there
                        Bob"
                        would
                        be
                        translated as "üçï
                        üçï".
